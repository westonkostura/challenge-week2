# Weston Kostura's Portfolio

## Description

This project is a landing site for my portfolio page. The reason for this project is for employers and others to see what work I have done, all in one place to see everything. This project taught me how to schedule with tutors, and excel with html and css.



## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](/assets/images/screenshot1.png?raw=true "Screenshot 1")
![alt text](/assets/images/screenshot2.png?raw=true "Screenshot 2")


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
