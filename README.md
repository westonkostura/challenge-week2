# Weston Kostura's Portfolio

## Description

This project is a landing site for my portfolio page. The reason for this project is for employers and others to see what work I have done, all in one place to see everything. This project taught me how to schedule with tutors and excel with HTML and CSS.



## Usage

Use of the Portfolio website is to read about me, the author, see the work that I have completed and also links to contact me. In the future, I will add additional projects and my uploaded resume.

## Credits

I followed examples of HTML and CSS everywhere from our ASU-activities that we cover in class, with also using w3schools and Stack Overflow. 
I also received help from a tutor through the boot camp spot with Scott Everett, who helped me clean up the page and add key requirements for the project.
